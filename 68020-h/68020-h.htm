<p class="dropcap">It is now two thousand years ago that Horace sang that triumph-song
of his which has rung ever since:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Exegi monumentum aere perennius.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The succession of numberless years and the very flight of time
have left that monument still higher than the pyramids of kings,
for it was a good thing, and he knew it, and we to-day know it.
Perhaps it is well for us to stop a moment and wonder a little just
what we are leaving, which after two thousand years, will stand
so, firm-fixed, splendidly living.</p>

<p>We look at this century of ours, we try to see it as might a
future historian, and find a surprising hodge-podge. Fully judge
it without the future, we cannot, yet, because everything is moving
at such a terrific rate, these days, the present and the future are
almost one, and we are thus enabled to pass partial judgment at
least. Partial judgment—and on what? A world disillusioned,
its ideals smashed, or, more tragic even, forgot; in the field of its
arts, new music, new poetry, new painting; and over and above
all, Science triumphant.</p>

<p>We need say nothing about the world in general—it is out of
place here, and we all know too much of wars and rumors of
wars, and the rest. So let us consider a moment then, the arts.—Such
new arts they are, too, and like most youngsters, so very
self-assertive! Their Muses are flapper-muses, and, like their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
physical prototypes, cause havoc enough. We have with us “the
arts, though unimagined, yet to be” of Shelley’s prophecy, and, to
Shelley, who loved Beauty and knew her, they would indeed be
unimaginable! Poetry, unformed and unthought; great loose-joined
masses of prose called novels; canvases, inch-deep with
modelled paint; statues of featureless faces, or rectangular
muscles; and music, uninspired, discordant aggregations of notes.
We grant these illegitimate members of the “progeny immortal
of painting, sculpture, and rapt poesy” do fall, under our very
eyes, prostrate along the path to lasting fame, with that goal still
not even in sight, nevertheless, men and women are gulled by
them, look, and admire even, in their breathless attempt to be
“astride the times”. Therein lies the tragedy—that they are
accepted.</p>

<p>And is it these—these outlandish oddities, and these gulled
seekers for the sensational—which are the monument we are
raising to ourselves that future generations may unearth them,
and smile a little at the magniloquent impotence of them all? And
if they do constitute our conception of a lasting contribution to
Time’s granary, are we to do nothing about it? Of course, we
being young, do take it all too seriously, for Youth always takes
everything, particularly itself, too seriously; but, we, being idealists,
stand to defend our ideals, which are mental discipline and
intellectual aristocracy. Surely the poor Muses are not to blame
that they are so misshapen and unlovely, for they are only the
manifestation of a moving Cause behind them, which Cause, it
seems to us, is mental sloppiness, a lack of intellectual discipline.
It is in opposition to the basic reason of the artistic monstrosities
of the age, then, that our ideals lie.</p>

<p>Shelley, in the preface to Prometheus Unbound, says: “Poets,
not otherwise than philosophers, painters, sculptors, and musicians,
are, in one case, the creators, and in another, the creations, of
their age”, and it is there we may find, perhaps, the explanation,
and at the same time a hint as to the solution of the whole problem:
the age with its chaos and inefficient efficiency has created
these inartistic artists; a new order of artists could re-create a
less chaotic order—it at least is a possible solution. For plainly,—the
terrific discordant elements hurtled into life through the agency
of the Great War are reflected on the arts. Huge, subconscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
forces, strong and like subway-trains jostling us onward through
the artificially-lighted dark, cannot but communicate themselves
with greatest intensity to the soul with the keenest sensibilities—to
the Artist; and the Artist, caught in the mighty whirligig of
Time, rushed on, unthinking, undisciplined for thought, to attain—anything.
Never having been thoroughly taught it, he has quite
forgot, if he ever by chance knew, that “genius is the capacity for
taking infinite pains”. But it is that that he should be taught;
it is that which should absolutely be driven home to him, lest chaos
become dissolution.</p>

<p>And how? The answer, in part, is the old, old answer which
must ring true so long as discipline, intellectually, means the more
perfect, and therefore the more beautiful result—the Classics. In
this age of science, such a suggestion, no doubt, is heretical—but
only consider it for a moment, one small phase of it as it applies
to us in the college world. Consider the undergraduate in a
university. Bewildered, he becomes a freshman, and suddenly
is presented with the sciences—myriad sciences: chemistry,
physics, biology, and the rest, for a year, at least, and then, too,
the great “dismal science”, Economics. Three or four years of
that last, in all its many inarticulate yet officially supported
branches, and he awakens, toward the end of his last year, to a
realization that there is something savoring, perhaps, of culture
somewhere in college: an unknown and irrevocably lost opportunity
which he can only regret. Then, prepared for life with
mathematical formulæ and economic theorizings, he steps forth,
becomes a business man, and is successful ordinarily. Well and
good, but his period of usefulness in business passes, and then,
with a mind untrained save in a few financial or mercantile facts,
which life has taught him, with even the interesting, if unsubstantial,
formulæ of college days clean forgot, and having no
background in anything of lasting interest, he floats along, uninterested
and uninteresting, mentally lonely, physically unfitted
longer to engage in the strong competition with youth—unhappy.</p>

<p>The Sciences, of themselves are good enough, have interest,
even romance, but they are specialized, rarified to such a degree
that they do not teach life, nor do they prepare for life, while in
their way, the Classics are life. In them lie the elements of—Heaven
spare the mark!—“efficiency” as well as of beauty; in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the study of them, the mind, saturated with their clear-cut brilliance,
and with their essential beauty of thought and phrase—peaceful
as a Greek temple, skillfully ordered and arranged as a
Pompeian dwelling—cannot but absorb those elements and understand,
far better, Life with all its niceties and its intellectual
challenges. The trained mind alone can overcome—but that mind
is not trained which can, parrot-like, recite formulæ, physical
laws, or bimetallic theories: that is a mind trained in the particular,
helpless outside of the special—and life and the living of
life is not particularism nor specialization.</p>

<p>And from where can the preparing of the cultured mind, and
the fighting away from the incubus of the formula come save from
our universities?—In Yale, of course, the great tradition of the
cultural education, and the influence of classicism, which—our
intellectual re-Renaissance to the contrary, notwithstanding—turned
out capable and self-reliant minds for generations before
the war, the war abruptly cut off the moment it won the battle of
science for Science. And not only in Yale, but generally throughout
the East—and it was alone in the East that the Classic spirit
lived—the eviction of Culture was general. But Yale has an
obsession to continue to be one vast primary school for scientists,
and the intellect of the undergraduate suffers. Like it or no, the
forcible entrance of the Sciences reduced Culture to a phantom,
and, to interpolate a definition, by culture is meant those elements
in the developed mind which make it self-sufficient, content, and
productive of Beauty. Such undergraduates, these days, as want
just those things must seek them out on their own initiative, and
find, in the quest, many surprising official stumbling-blocks, and
very little, if any, official assistance.</p>

<p>But it is just that that a university should stand for: it is the
production of great minds, trained in clear, broad ways of thinking,
self-sufficient, capable of escaping from the trammels of the
every-day. They must teach the thought-language of the great
minds of the past lest it be forgot, they must teach that universal
language which the future will understand, honor, and from which
it will draw benefit. And that, through a re-found stress on the
training of minds, on the broad, living principles of an Aristophanes
or of a Horace. Of course, the universities can do little
without the co-operation of the preparatory schools, but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
co-operation must be instigated and forced by the superior vision
and power of the higher educational institutions. The schools
should stand firmly for a higher standard of mental discipline,
a better preparation for the more mature problems of college life
with all their challenges to the mind, just as the colleges, further
advanced, should endeavor to make men better prepared for life,
and as the college graduates’ living of life with that background
should prepare them for the quiet time of old age, when the intellectual
failure or success of life will count more—far more—than
any pecuniary or social status. If the king is weak, his
subjects are weak, and often times revolt, and the universities
must not be weak. They, officially, and we undergraduates, personally,
should work toward a higher standard of intellect, for if
they and we do not, the next generation will not thank us for a
heritage of intellectual sloppiness—and may revolt. Above all,
we must not be satisfied with the average, but demand the exceptional,
exceptional minds and men, and more and more of them.
And if the universities can hold as their fixed purpose the creating
and maintaining of this higher order, and the creating again of
a higher order still they will once more be fulfilling the only
requirements for their existence. But they cannot go on blandly
saying that all is well: all is <i>not</i> well, and Pollyannaism in so
grave a question as that of laying the foundation for the mental
competence and the intellectual aristocracy of future generations
is bad taste, and is out of place. They cannot quietly take no
notice of the Classics, and say that in so far as they were driven
out they had best stay out: that is the easiest course to follow,
and the easiest course is seldom the best. Yale must be militant,
and now that the war is over, she should go back to pre-war—long
pre-war—standards.</p>

<p>Be idealists with us, and look toward the Future! We must,
together, never forget that out of chaos comes chaos, that out of
our communally undisciplined intellects must come more undisciplined
intellects, nor that we, after all, count little in comparison
to the coming generations, for our potentialities we are realizing,
or have realized, and their potentialities are yet untouched.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Toward midnight, Paul Duval emerged from 355 McDougal
Street, quietly closed the battered door behind him, and
descended the steps. He slouched along the street, with the brim
of his felt hat, which dangled over his ears, flapping up and down
to the rhythm of his stride. Probably, he thought, some one
would take him for a murderer or a burglar—although, to be
sure, such people use automobiles in this twentieth century. Paul
was especially conscious that the policeman leaning against a post
of the elevated railway, did peer at him searchingly, whistled
something, and twirled his stick meditatively. But perhaps all
this was fancy, aided by the dim light of the arcs.</p>

<p>It was, however, likely that Paul carried with him a remnant
of the atmosphere of the death-chamber he had just left—the
green-walled room in the rear of 355 where Hanaré Tierens had
died—and that the remembrance of this most recent experience
created in his mind a marked sensitiveness to ghostly things such
as policemen and Greenwich Village arc-lights. That calm, livid
face, with its peculiarly French nose, had passed through some
experience of which Paul, at least, knew nothing. He still felt
the pressure of Hanaré’s hand, which he had held until the last
moment. It had relaxed and become dead. What a world of
truth and wonder was there in that moment, that relaxation!</p>

<p>Few men, Paul thought, had ever passed through emotions such
as his own had been. It was bad enough to see one’s old friend
and adviser die; to feel a hand relax, the way Hanaré’s had; to
realize that it belonged no longer to a friend or an adviser. This,
Paul reflected, was bad enough. But there had also been a girl—Hanaré’s
daughter; a girl whom Paul had passionately loved
for the last five years; a girl whose drawn, white face stood out
now in his memory, like a ghost, to aggravate the torture in his
heart. These two had sat facing each other during the last hours,
when the doctor had gone, and the rest of the house was asleep.
They had not exchanged a word. The tragedy had been heightened
by the silence. Paul had expressed his love too often for her to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
be able to forget, even at this time, the intensity of his passion.
And once, when their eyes met, he knew that in her young heart
one more sorrow had thus been added to her present burden—a
sympathy for him, and a feeling of almost shame that she could
not respond to his love.</p>

<p>Then there had been a frightful kind of mental telepathy which
carried even his most involuntary thoughts over to her. How
could he help thinking that since she was now alone, without her
father, she might accept him as a lover and a protector? How
could he avoid extending his sympathy for her distress into a
conviction that, since she needed comfort, some overt expression
of his love was justified? Indeed, once when she had laid her
head in despair upon the dying man’s breast, Paul had stretched
out his hand and stroked her hair. She had, then, taken his hand
in hers, pressed it, and released it. The situation only seemed to
strengthen the barrier between them, and to make them even
more intensely conscious of it.</p>

<p>These thoughts flowed slowly through Paul’s mind, now that
he was out on the street, walking toward his apartment. He
cursed himself for his selfishness and for bringing into a death-chamber
such passions and emotions, thereby to heighten a young
girl’s distress. What if they were the passions of a lifetime!
What if they had caused him inexpressible suffering! He was
none the less a selfish brute, immersed in his own selfishness.</p>

<p>Upon passing a quick-lunch room, he decided to enliven his
tired mind by indulging in some coffee and doughnuts. He
opened the door, walked past the shiny, white-topped tables, and
approached the counter. Here he was at once surprised by the
beauty of the girl’s face, which confronted him, and which stood
out against the background of coffee containers, cups, saucers,
shredded wheat boxes, and the like, as though an inhabitant of
his dreams had been transposed to this earthly environment. Paul,
who was sleepy and dazed, stared at her until she was forced to
drop her lashes and hide from him the blue depths of her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am Paul Duval,” he said, in his absent-minded way, “and
I should like some coffee.”</p>

<p>The girl turned and drew it from the container. Paul watched
her—the slim back and the delicate, white skin which showed
through her fine blouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“A strange world,” he sighed as she turned toward him with
the coffee. “Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>He had not meant it offensively. And as she gazed into his
vague, grey eyes, saw the sallow cheeks and the whimsical expression
on the mouth, she divined that he was not talking about the
world but about himself.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I think you are a strange person!” she laughed, turned on her
heel gayly, and pretended to busy herself with something below
the counter. Paul noticed that her voice was quite cultured.</p>

<p>“Do you work here—always?” he asked.</p>

<p>“One week,” she passed nonchalantly from one little task to
another. “This is my first night’s work—my last, too—Fred
was sick.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Fred?” Paul found it difficult to keep up with her.</p>

<p>“Night-man. Did you want anything else?” She leaned across
the counter, exposing her slim arms, and a pair of delicate hands.
She looked up at him, laughing.</p>

<p>Stupidly he remembered that he had come there to drink coffee.
He fumbled for his cup.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “—eh—that is—I’d like some doughnuts.”</p>

<p>She procured the doughnuts, and Paul reluctantly shambled
off to a nearby table, where he sat down, facing the counter. It
was indeed strange that this girl should exert so much attraction
over him. He had seen beautiful women before during his
twenty-six years of varied existence. However, he remembered
with a smile that since women had meant anything to him at all,
he had been in love: first with a stolidly serious young lady, who
was now married to a man much older than herself, and then with
Marie Tierens. This latter affair had been going on for the past
five or six years. It had become his ideal. It had given Paul
the conviction that if a man is going to marry a decent woman,—well—the
least he can do is to be decent himself. At the heart of
civilization, he thought, lay the unitary standard. And thus he
had crossed in safety numerous pitfalls which present themselves
to the average hack-writer—the small dealer in ideas.</p>

<p>But to-night, ah, well—even one’s deepest ideals are shattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
at times. The excruciating emotions of the past few hours had
left him like a rudderless ship, adrift in a sea of bewildering
passions. Hanaré was gone now. Without Hanaré life could
never be the same. And Hanaré’s daughter had changed. She
had become an independent woman. There was defiance in her
eyes, instead of that ancient girlishness which had always kept
hope alive in Paul’s heart. Indeed, the world had changed. For
better or for worse, Paul, too, had changed.</p>

<p>In those intense moments of a man’s lifetime, wherein the past,
together with the ideals which epitomize the past, are relinquished
and a new method of life undertaken—in those moments a man
is not fully conscious of all that he is doing. He moves in
response to the predominant feeling in his heart. And there
opens up before him new and unexplored vistas of life, at the
other end of which he hopes to find some sort of Eldorado.
To-night Paul was craving for beauty. Beauty to alleviate the
coarseness of the death-chamber. Beauty to help him forget the
face and the eyes of a girl who could no longer truly be called
“his” girl.</p>

<p>He was awakened from his short reverie by a voice close beside
him. “Good-night,” it said cheeringly. Paul looked up to behold
the girl of the counter, in a blue serge dress, with a dark blue hat
slanted to one side of her head. She waved to him as she passed.
Paul gathered his queer legs together, and arose.</p>

<p>“Eh—are you going?”</p>

<p>The girl turned. “Yes,” she said, “I’m only on duty until
one o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Really? Is it <i>that late</i>?” He felt for his watch, but could
not find it.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said the girl again.</p>

<p>“I say,” said Paul, as though he were embarrassed, “perhaps—well—wouldn’t
it be rather nice if I were to take you home? We
could—eh—go somewhere—dance—first.”</p>

<p>“Dance! At one o’clock?” she laughed. “I don’t think we
could.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>She made no move to go, nor did Paul, who was standing close
to her. At length she took hold of his arm.</p>

<p>“Well, are you coming?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>They walked out of the restaurant and down the deserted street
together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night spent itself. Some sort of a dawn crept across the
city and touched the edges of the windows in the rear of 355
McDougal Street. As the grey light penetrated the room on the
third floor, a girl, who had been lying across the body of a dead
man, arose, looked stupidly about her, rubbed her eyes, and went
over to the window where she gazed across the damp Greenwich
Village roofs. She thought, perhaps, that she was going mad,
with this silence which penetrated her whole nature, like the cold
dawn that had just penetrated the night. But, strangely enough,
it was not altogether her own loneliness, nor yet the painful sense
of loss at the death of her father, nor even the ghostliness of his
figure on the bed, that was thus driving her toward insanity.
Rather, it was the remembrance of Paul’s face, the knowledge of
his suffering for her, and the feeling that, although she could
never love him—really love him, as she had pictured love in her
girlhood dreams—still, the death of her father had removed the
last tangible excuse which she had to offer him. She felt that
it was not right to add to his sorrow for Hanaré’s death, a still
larger grief caused by her own selfishness.</p>

<p>She smiled tearfully as she gazed out of the window. Why,
she was making it appear like a case of duty!—and, of course,
no one ought to marry for duty. Actually, it was not altogether
a case of duty. Actually, she was alone—and afraid of her own
loneliness. Indeed, the image of Paul came to her like a light
shining through the darkness. He was forced upon her, by the
strength of circumstances. Hanaré was gone now. Without
Hanaré life could never be the same. Paul had become essential
to her very existence. Love him or not, he was essential to her
existence.</p>

<p>As the sun rose and the day wore on, and she went about her
necessary tasks, it seemed to her almost as though she loved Paul.
She had never had a feeling quite so compelling as this. Before
her father’s death, she had never wished to marry. She had
contemplated some sort of a career, with her painting and her
sculpture, which she inherited from Hanaré. Besides, her father
had needed her. He had been a solitary man, with few friends,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
a dreamy personality, and so absent-minded that he required her
constant attention. Thus life had seemed to her best, close to her
father’s side, managing the little household, and doing her art at
her leisure. The thought of children to take care of revolted her.
And as yet no passion had entered her life, sufficiently powerful
to make this secluded existence seem trivial or repulsive. Nor
was there anything about Paul Duval to attract her strongly. He
was the nicest and kindest man in the world, and he loved Hanaré;
but for a husband—well—what was the use of a husband,
anyway?</p>

<p>She felt differently now. She wanted Paul. Yet all day he
stayed away.</p>

<p>Toward evening there came to her again the sensation that she
was going mad. It was simply inhuman of Paul to leave her
alone like this. There had been, of course, the neighbors, who
offered their sympathetic assistance, and who tried to comfort
this strange, silent girl, whom none of them understood. But
because of her yearning for Paul, the neighbors only aggravated
her nervous sorrow. And although she had consented to sleep
with an elderly woman in another part of the house, until her
father should be buried, nevertheless, late that night, she felt herself
irresistibly drawn to Hanaré’s stiff corpse; and she crept into
the ghostly room, in her night-gown, to appease that unnatural
craving. This was about ten o’clock. She sat for some minutes
on the edge of the bed, but could find no consolation. Suddenly
she jumped up with the wild resolve to go to Paul’s apartment
and find out what had happened to him.</p>

<p>She reflected, as she slipped on her clothes, that this was a
most unwomanly course of action. She was impelled toward it
by the almost inhuman nature of her circumstances. She hoped
Paul would understand. She hoped nothing had happened to
him. Perhaps she could even be of some comfort to him, in this
recent sorrow which so obviously depressed him.</p>

<p>In fact, as she made her away along the winding streets of
Greenwich Village, Marie began to feel almost exultant. A new
joy entered her heart, because she was relieving herself of intolerable
burdens, and because, too, she was bringing to Paul a surprise-present
for which he had been waiting many years. She
began timidly to picture to herself Paul’s expression, first upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
seeing her, and later—perhaps even days later—when he should
realize what this new resolve of hers meant to both of them. She
found herself immensely relieved at the thought of transferring
her small belongings from her present dreary apartment to his
own. Her collection of books, her pictures, yes, and even her
paints and her sculptor’s tools—all these she would show to Paul
as belonging to both of them together. In his eyes and in his
mouth would come that look of appreciation for things which
were such precious possessions. It would be inexpressible relief!
A happy life! They were both dreamers—</p>

<p>She arrived, a trifle breathless, at his apartment, which was
four stories up in a brick building that boasted of no elevator.
She knocked several times on the thin, wooden door, but no one
answered. So she tried the door knob, found that it was unlatched,
opened the door timidly, and gazed in. There was a
vestibule leading into the sitting-room, and since the latter was
lighted, she proceeded on tip-toe toward it. Upon entering she
perceived a long, narrow room, hazy with tobacco smoke and
heavy with the odor of stale whiskey. The bric-a-brac and furniture
were in a state of disorder. There were a couple of empty
bottles on the table—glasses and books. She perceived a thin,
sallow figure, sprawled out in the morris chair, staring at her in
a glazed way, like a dead man.</p>

<p>“Paul!” she cried.</p>

<p>Paul moved slowly, blinked his eyes, shuddered. “Eh?”</p>

<p>“Paul!”</p>

<p>“I should not have wished you to see me like this,” he said, as
though her coming were the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>“Are you—all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little dazed.”</p>

<p>“Why have you been drinking?”</p>

<p>He sighed and bowed his head, in a tired way, until his chin
touched his disordered bow-tie. But he did not answer.</p>

<p>Impulsively Marie ran over to his side and knelt there, with her
arms upon the chair.</p>

<p>“Are—are you drunk, Paul?” She had rarely seen drunken
men.</p>

<p>He raised his head then and looked into her eyes, which were so
close to his. “No,” he said. “I have been drinking, but I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
not drunk. I am merely dazed, by death, and by life—but mostly
by life. Life is so strange. Have you never thought that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No—no—no! Not the way I have thought it. You only
know the half of life—Hanaré’s half. You have inherited, now,
Hanaré’s domain. Innocent, childish Hanaré! You are the
mistress of his innocence and his naïveté. But it will never—never—never
be the same again.”</p>

<p>“Paul! What do you mean?”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>They lapsed into silence then, for Marie saw that he was in
one of those unintelligible moods, which had often come upon him,
but which she had never seen so pronounced.</p>

<p>“Why did you stay away all day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Have I been away all day? I had forgotten.”</p>

<p>“I have been lonely and miserable, Paul.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry. I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>“How could you forget?”</p>

<p>“How? There are plenty of ways to forget.” He arose and
strode up and down the room restlessly.</p>

<p>“How could <i>I</i> forget?” She looked at him as though he had
wounded her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>They were silent while Paul continued to walk up and down.
At length he proceeded.</p>

<p>“Certainly my being there wouldn’t have helped much, would
it? It isn’t as though you had ever allowed me to love you or
comfort you! God knows, I’ve been ready to do so—any time.
I thought you hated me. Do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “at this moment I hate you intensely.”</p>

<p>“Why did you come here, then—if you hate me?”</p>

<p>“O Paul, Paul! Because I needed you!”</p>

<p>He stared at her. This woman! “I didn’t suppose anybody
needed me now, except the devil.”</p>

<p>He saw then that she was crying and that he had hurt her
tremendously. He saw distinctly that he had been unjust. But
his mind could not piece together the broken fragments of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
situation. He, too, had been unjustly treated: it was not fair
for a woman to allow a man to love her for six years, and to hold
herself away from him merely for the sake of her own career—her
own whimsical happiness. He felt that in the hour of need
Marie had not been with him. He felt this even more keenly
than his own cruelty toward her now.</p>

<p>“My God!” he exclaimed, in the midst of his meditation. “What
twenty-four hours will do!”</p>

<p>There was undisguised bitterness in his words; a bitterness
which Marie, conscious of the unprecedence of her behavior,
construed as an expression of his scorn for what she called her
“unwomanliness”. Her excited mind only served to intensify the
horrid picture which she had drawn of herself. To think that
she had come this way to Paul, of all people! Even the awful
atmosphere of her father’s death-chamber could not excuse her
for doing so. She wished that she could hide herself away. She
was ashamed of her body—her very existence.</p>

<p>But Paul was not thinking of these things. He was merely
astounded at the change that the night had wrought in himself.</p>

<p>“I wish to hell Hanaré hadn’t died,” he exclaimed suddenly,
and without any reason for it. “Life is nothing but a constant
attempt to adjust ourselves to the tragedy of existence. Since
we cannot tell to-day what will happen to-morrow, we never quite
succeeded in our adjustments: and so, there’s always a tragedy.
We go on and on—like that!”</p>

<p>He felt master of himself now. But Marie supposed that he
was lecturing her. There was an element of brutality in it.</p>

<p>“If we were automatons,” Paul proceeded, as though the sound
of his own voice helped to drive away the real tragedy behind—“if
we were all automatons, who acted out one day the same as
any other, incapable of making fools out of ourselves,—why then,
life might be worth living. But some fool of a God—a <i>fool</i> God—gave
us this power to make mistakes. Marie, for the past six
years both our lives have been mistakes. And now just see what
you have done—and what <i>I</i> have done.”</p>

<p>Marie stood facing him, and clenched her fists.</p>

<p>“Paul Duval, you are undoubtedly the most unfeeling man in
the world—the most pitiless—the most un—unreasonable. I
know I’m a little fool! Do you suppose I have no sensibilities?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Do you sup—? Oh, heaven!” She fell back again into the armchair,
weeping.</p>

<p>The situation between them had changed tremendously in one
night, because his ideals had become incompatible with her ideals,
his life had lost that simplicity and innocence which they had
once shared together. Paul found that his love for her, just yesterday
so vivid and passionate, had changed, and had converted
itself into a red and golden derelict of the past, which he still
loved, though in a different way. Like Dante, his love for a face
and a living body had transformed itself into an intellectual remembrance—an
ideal—a hope which, while it might later be fulfilled
in some immortal existence, had lost, once and forever, its
earthly potency. Just as the death of Beatrice had forced Dante
to relinquish the earthly passion, so the death of Hanaré, which
brought the confusing emotions of last night, had led Paul to
reconceive Marie and transform her into a vanished reality, an
ideal, rather than a living being. He had tasted, now, that side
of life which does not permit of the more refined loves.</p>

<p>Indeed it was a strange position to be in: and the tragedy of it
lay in the fact that he could never make it clear to Marie why he
had done as he had, and why the relationship between them was
now changed. Tremendous, this change!—almost infinite in
character. Especially, she would never understand how it had
come about so quickly. He sighed. “With questions like this,”
he said, “of life and death—time has little, if anything, to do.”</p>

<p>He began to reflect that the course he had taken was an evil one.
And although the forces which had led him along this course were
still potent, nevertheless the sudden apparition of Marie into the
midst of them recalled his old life with her, if nothing else. And
this feeling, that he had better go back, repent, and, if possible,
forget the slight digression of the night before, grew upon him,
just as a glimmer of light, which increases in intensity, turns at
last into a ball of fire. He even came to the conclusion that it was
his duty to marry her. He felt that he had no right to add to her
sorrow for Hanaré’s death, a still larger grief caused by his own
selfishness.</p>

<p>He smiled then. He was making it out to be a wretched case
of duty—and of course no one ought to marry for duty. Actually
it was not altogether a case of duty. Actually he was alone in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
new sea of conflicting passions, lost ideals, and hopelessness,—and
he was afraid of his own loneliness. Indeed, the picture of
Marie sitting there came to him as a light shining through the
darkness. He no longer loved her. True. But he felt that in
her he could find some salvation from the horrible destiny which
immediately confronted him, and a relief from his present
wretchedness.</p>

<p>“Marie,” he said suddenly. “You know that I have loved
you!”</p>

<p>“Yes. You have said so. I believe it.”</p>

<p>“Last night there came into my life something which you could
not understand—which I cannot explain now—which some day I
hope to forget.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, anxiously, as though fearing unknown
things.</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t look at me that way. Let the past take care of the
past. You shall know some day. I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell me now?”</p>

<p>“Because you would not understand—you would not appreciate—nor
could I tell it as it is.”</p>

<p>“You only arouse my worst fears by talking this way,” she
said. “I came to you as a friend, for consolation. I came in
order to forget that horrible room. I wanted your companionship—perhaps
for always. But you have only succeeded in
making me more disturbed. I do not understand you.”</p>

<p>He went over to her chair, and sat down beside her, and put
his arm around her.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said. “You and I must escape the tragedy of our
existence. Together we will fly away from it. You will forget
that room, and I—I shall forget myself.”</p>

<p>She drew away from him a little—from his impetuosity. “I
don’t love you, that way,” she said.</p>

<p>“Great heaven! Nor do I love you <i>that</i> way, any more. You
are too idealistic, Marie. Marriage, for you and me, is no longer
an ideal, but a necessity. We will escape, that way. We will
rest in peace and Hanaré’s death will be forgotten.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but sat there as though meditating. Suddenly,
from far out in the city, came the boom of a clock—a lonely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
thing beating the hour of midnight. It awoke Paul to realities.
And, although he had so far been master of the situation, he now
lost control of himself, and cried: “Twelve o’clock! You must
go now, you must go!” And as she stared at him, mystified, he
cried again, “You must go, you must go!”</p>

<p>He took her arm, and she arose. They stood facing each other.</p>

<p>“Promise me,” he said, “that you will marry me—to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes. Impulsively he took her in his arms
and kissed her—not passionately, but as he would a little child.
And then he led her toward the vestibule.</p>

<p>Even then there was a knock at the door. He did not answer.
He looked at Marie, and she at him.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” she asked.</p>

<p>He turned bitterly away. “Nobody! Fate!”</p>

<p>The door opened, since he had given no answer. There was
a moment of suspense while the visitor was hidden in the vestibule.
Then the girl of the counter, looking extraordinarily pretty, came
toward them. She started imperceptibly upon seeing Marie, but
regained her composure.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” Paul replied, but did not move.</p>

<p>The girl proceeded to take off her hat in front of the mirror,
and to make herself at home, adjusting her brown hair prettily
and helping herself to a cigarette from the box on the table. “You
look tired,” she said “And the room’s a mess. Is there no one
to clean up for you?”</p>

<p>Paul did not answer.</p>

<p>Marie could do nothing but stare. She stared at the girl and
then at Paul. Suddenly she ran toward the door and was gone.</p>

<p>“Who was that?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“That is Hanaré Tierens’ daughter. Why did you come?”</p>

<p>“You told me to come at twelve.”</p>

<p>Paul sat down and put his hands over his face. “You have
ruined everything,” he said.</p>

<p>“So you told me last night.”</p>

<p>“Did I? I had forgotten.”</p>

<p>“You said an old friend had died—and that you were in love
with his daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Really? I was quite frank, wasn’t I?” Her reference to
Marie exasperated him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross.” She came up close to him and put her hand
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I am not going to kiss you,” said Paul, anticipating her.</p>

<p>“I haven’t asked you to, have I?”</p>

<p>“No; but I’m going to marry Ma—Hanaré’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“There! I knew you had something like that in your mind!
You look so—so determined,” she laughed, in spite of her obvious
vexation.</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> determined.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>He started. “You? You aren’t going to make a fuss about
it, are you?”</p>

<p>“That’s impudent!” She turned away from him and sat down
upon the sofa restlessly.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be! Last night you let me know well enough
what you thought of me. But I don’t mind, because I know that
is what I am. I can’t remember ever being anything else; though,
of course, if one is to be a man’s mistress, one has the right of
choosing the man. I prefer education to ignorance, and a decent
amount of politeness to mere brutality.”</p>

<p>“I am not merely brutal!” He stood up and faced her as he
said it. “It’s you who are brutal—or at least you will be before
you have done with me. Women are all cruel, because they
understand men so well. Our souls are torn first by one and then
by the other. I should like to make you see, however, that I
have a duty to perform.”</p>

<p>“Duty?” She arose from the sofa, and came to stand beside
him again.</p>

<p>“A duty to myself and—to some one else.”</p>

<p>“There’s a difference between duty and love, isn’t there?” This
time she appeared to have no scruples, for she put her arms around
him, frankly, and stood looking up at him. He held himself
rigidly away from her.</p>

<p>“I am not going to kiss you,” he said again. That appeared
to be his last defense in any case.</p>

<p>She made no answer to that, except to deny it with her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a witch!” he cried, drawing away from her suddenly.
“A positive instrument of the devil. Leave me alone!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why? Because I am going to marry Marie. Because, for
Hanaré’s sake, I’m going to forget you. I was a fool last night.”</p>

<p>“Last night you said you’d rather be a fool than a wise man.
I suppose you have forgotten <i>that</i> also.”</p>

<p>He cringed. “No,” he said, “I have not forgotten that.” He
began wandering about the room as though hunting for something,
picking up piles of papers, looking underneath the tables
and chairs.</p>

<p>“What are you hunting for?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My hat.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go out?”</p>

<p>“I’m going out. You can do as you please. I’m going over
to see Marie.”</p>

<p>“Marie? At this time of night?”</p>

<p>He found his hat behind the sofa. He put it on, pulling the
soft brim far down over his eyes.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he said casually, as he walked out of the room.
He was not fully conscious that there was anybody else there.
He had one determination. In view of that everything else was
forgotten.</p>

<p>Vain resolve! The windows at 355 McDougal Street were
brilliantly lighted, policemen were in front of the door, people
stared, and there was general confusion. Some one had been
killed. Paul learned, finally, that Marie had committed suicide.</p>

<p>He felt, rather, that he had committed murder.</p>

<p>Thus, when he return to his own apartment and found the girl
still there, he was glad to forget Hanaré’s death that way instead.</p>

<h3 id="Inspiration"><i>Inspiration</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The smoking-room gave a terrific lurch. As if the motion
had been a signal, Carlos Bentley abruptly broke off his
sentence, at the same time removing his hand from the arm of
his companion’s chair. Although the big steamer recovered almost
immediately from the unexpected blow, Carlos continued to
remain silent, his gaze wandering uncertainly around the comfortable
room. But he did not notice particularly the brown
sleekness of the leather chairs nor the subtle masculinity of the
lighting. He was wondering whether he had not again let his
tongue run away with his good taste in allowing it to run on over
the history of his past two weeks to this gentleman to whom he
had introduced himself. That was one of Carlos’ <i>bête-noirs</i>—a
cheerful frankness and lack of reserve that made him communicate
things he wished later he had kept to himself. But after all
the fellow had looked lonely and— A polite question which
interrupted his train of thought finished by driving the self-reproaches
from his mind. He answered the question at some
length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes! We spent six months in Paris. I got to know the
place quite well—well enough to get tired of it. I’m looking
forward to New York as a change. If it hadn’t been for my
wife, I’d have come back before, but she insisted on our staying—for
my own good, she said. You see, I went over to study
art—portraits mainly. Spent hours every day looking at pictures
and trying to copy them.”</p>

<p>“Do you plan to take up art as a profession?” asked his companion,
knocking the ashes from his pipe. He was an elderly man
who had an air of demanding confidences with a view of solving
any difficulties connected with them from the depths of a thoughtful
urbanity.</p>

<p>Carlos hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said finally, “I expect to. That’s my ultimate aim.
But, of course, after all this studying I’ll want a bit of a rest—say
a month or so. Then I’ll be ready to get down to work.”</p>

<p>The other nodded a thoughtful assent. Then—</p>

<p>“You’ll pardon the remark, but—you have an income, I take it.”</p>

<p>Bentley nodded.</p>

<p>“Very fortunate, very fortunate indeed. So many poor devils
have to start with literally nothing but their talent. You’re
unusually blessed. Well, I must be getting to bed. We dock
early to-morrow, I believe. I’ve enjoyed talking to you immensely,
and you’ll pardon my leaving so abruptly, won’t you? Good-night.”</p>

<p>Carlos stood gazing after him a moment; then, turning away,
went off in the direction of his own stateroom. He had an
uneasy feeling that the man had not quite approved of him, although
he was unable to explain what he himself had said that
could have given ground for such an opinion.</p>

<p>When he got to his stateroom, he found a message that his wife
had left on his bureau before going to bed. It had come by wireless
that evening and was from his father. On opening it, he
read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Meet you at pier. Glad you are settling down
to work at last.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Dad.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Carlos laughed softly. Just like his father to mention work,
even in a wireless. It occurred to him that everyone, ever since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
he was a boy, had been wanting him to work. They had all told
him what great things they expected of his talent if he would
only use it. His mother had cherished a letter from a boyhood
schoolmaster, which dwelt in glowing terms on his artistic ability,
while at the same time it decried his indolence. His wife had
refused many suitors as importunate and more wealthy than he
because she was in love with him, and believed that her love could
make him fight for the success which was expected of him. Well,
his father was right—it was time to start work. They had had
enough disappointments in him, and now he must do something
to make them proud of him. It wouldn’t be hard.</p>

<p>In an exceedingly virtuous mood Carlos bent over and kissed
his sleeping wife. What a wonderful girl Eloise was, and what
a trump to have believed in him enough to have married him. He
would work as he never had before as soon as they got settled in
New York. With which resolutions he got into bed to dream
of painting portraits for the kings and queens of Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four months later in a studio-apartment in the low Fifties a
wet paint-brush was hurled viciously at a small statue of the
Laocoon. It struck the largest figure full in the face with a
comforting smack, and clattered to the floor. Carlos Bentley
had been trying to do a portrait. Eloise, who in lieu of a regular
model had been sitting for him, started at the sound, then relaxed
her pose. She was an appealing figure with a touch of dynamic
force in the aggressive tilt of her chin that made Carlos, jokingly
and yet half-seriously, call her his will-power; at this moment she
seemed to be bracing herself as if to meet something.</p>

<p>“Why, Carlos dear, what is the matter?” she asked, approaching
her husband doubtfully.</p>

<p>Carlos stood before a half-finished picture removing his painting
jacket, which he hurled into a corner before turning to his
wife.</p>

<p>“I’m going to stop,” he said impatiently. “I don’t seem to
feel in a mood for it to-day somehow. Besides we’ve been working
for quite a while and we need a rest.” His eyes met hers
half-defiantly, as if he were expecting some remonstrance. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
he added, “Come on down to a show, dear. We can do some
more to-night on this.”</p>

<p>His wife turned away.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to go down, Carlos,” she answered slowly, “and
I had hoped you’d want to work this afternoon. We’ve only
been up here a little over an hour. Won’t you stay a little longer?
You were just beginning to get the right feeling in the picture. I
know you were.”</p>

<p>Carlos laughed and kissed her.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of time for the picture and it’s too wonderful
an afternoon to stay indoors. I’m going out for a walk. Sorry
you won’t come.” He slammed the door as he went out.</p>

<p>Eloise sat down dejectedly on a straight chair. Her lips
trembled until she could hardly keep from crying. For seven
weeks this same thing had happened continuously until she was
sick to death of trying to fight against it. Every day Carlos had
alternated playing around the city with attempts to work which
always ended like to-day. In all that time he had only finished
one picture—but it had been good, and had shown the talent that
was being wasted. If only she knew some way to touch the spark
to that talent. Eloise found herself wondering whether perhaps
she had not undertaken a task too difficult even for her love. It
seemed as if Carlos utterly lacked the requisite energy to produce
what he was capable of. With a sigh she turned to putting the
studio in order.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Carlos, after wandering out onto the street, had set
off in the direction of the park. The refreshing air of a sunny
autumn afternoon soon cleared his brain, but there was still an
uneasy feeling in the back of his mind. He felt that he ought to
be working, yet was unable to, and he knew vaguely that he was
not happy even in the freedom of the moment. In this contradictory
frame of mind he entered the park, strolling aimlessly
along the walks, where the park-loungers basked in the unexpected
warmth, and nurse-maids and children tried to make the best of
each other’s company. Carlos, deep in thought, paid little attention
to anyone unless some child inadvertently threatened to collide
with him, when he would start, step aside, and relapse again into
his reverie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>It was during one of these lapses that Carlos failed to note the
appearance of a phenomenon. This consisted of a very dirty girl
who was leading—or being led by—a little white dog on a long
rope, who, strangely enough, was as clean as his mistress was
dirty. The two came charging down the path toward Carlos,
evidently expecting to go past him on the left. But just before
they reached him, the little dog with all the unexpectedness of
little dogs darted to the right. The next moment Carlos was
startled to feel his feet being jerked backward and wound up
tightly in several yards of cotton clothesline on one end of which
was a little girl, who was the most striking surprise of all. In
spite of an evident absence of any recent ablution her features had
a peculiarly charming grace which was surprising under the circumstances
and so pleasant that Carlos found suddenly that he
wanted to paint it.</p>

<p>When the child straightened up from her task of unwinding the
little white dog, which she now held in her arms, she was adorable
as she tried confusedly to explain and apologize for what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Never mind that—I don’t appear to be any the worse. But
would you mind telling me your name?”</p>

<p>The vision was entirely agreeable.</p>

<p>“It’s Rosalie,” she replied. “At least I think so. I haven’t no
father or mother. I live with Aunt Bess, but Toots is my dog.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to paint a picture of you, Rosalie. That’s my business,
you see; I’m an artist—or supposed to be. Do you think your
aunt would let you come up to my house to-morrow afternoon,
and would you like to?”</p>

<p>The child stared open eyed, but she quickly assimilated the facts.
Her reply was frank.</p>

<p>“Sure I would. Aunt Bess don’t care where I go. Will you
have some cookies? What do you want to paint me for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there might be something to eat. Then you will come?
That’s fine. My house is at 16 West 5—th Street. Can you
remember that, Rosalie?” The child nodded. “Then I’ll expect
you at two o’clock to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>Carlos walked home in high spirits. The child’s face had so
impressed him that it seemed as if he could never wait till the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
next day. Eloise was still at the apartment. To her he recounted
his find in such glowing terms that she began to share his enthusiasm
and help him make his plans.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to give her a bath,” he said cheerfully. “She’s
horribly dirty. And we’ve got to find out whether she can come
regularly. But we can do that to-morrow. Let’s celebrate to-night.
I know a wonderful little restaurant. By the way, her
name’s Rosalie.”</p>

<p>They were still talking about the child when they returned late
in the evening.</p>

<p>The next afternoon at a quarter of two the bell rang, and
Rosalie was announced by a shocked and protesting doorman.
Shortly after Rosalie herself appeared. Believing it her duty to
do her best to make the picture a success, and feeling that the
occasion demanded something out of the ordinary, the child had
worn her best clothes and even gone to the length of a somewhat
tentative washing. The dress—it was her Sunday one, she explained—was
hideous, but Eloise, who was as fascinated by the
child as her husband had been, with infinite tact persuaded her to
put on some things they had bought for her the afternoon before.</p>

<p>Posing the child presented little difficulty. All Carlos asked
was to have her sit in a little rocker with an open picture book
in her lap, which Rosalie did with such a natural grace and
unembarrassed manner that she might have been sitting in little
rockers for her picture all her life. Her hair, which Eloise had
loosened, hung in long curls that completely covered her shoulders,
and from which the exquisite little face looked out like an ivory
miniature in a golden frame. As he gazed speechless at the effect,
Carlos knew that at last he had found his inspiration. He began
feverishly to sketch in the first rough outlines of the portrait.</p>

<p>As long as the light lasted he worked rapidly, looking up at the
child on the platform where the chair had been placed and down
to the canvas, as he touched it with quick, sure strokes. Sometimes
he paused, seemingly forgetful of the picture, looking for
long intervals at the girl as if to draw her whole personality out
of herself and place it on the canvas. Finally Rosalie began to
become more and more restless, until Eloise was forced to interrupt
the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to stop now, dear,” she said. “The poor child is
tired out and it’s too dark now, anyway.”</p>

<p>Carlos paid no attention, but went on painting. All he said
was, “Tell her to sit still. Can’t stop now.”</p>

<p>But at last she persuaded him to lay aside his brushes, so that
Rosalie could go home, after promising faithfully to return the
next afternoon. Carlos was triumphant.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be the best thing I ever did. The kid gets into
me in a way I can’t explain, but I’m putting it in the picture.”</p>

<p>For two weeks the child came almost every day and each time
the picture advanced further. Carlos had been right—it was the
best thing he had ever done, incomparably the best. To Eloise,
who in the months in Paris had gained a good critical knowledge
of pictures, it was evident that it was a masterpiece. The feeling
of greatness was in it; in the perfection of the body, in the grace
of the pose, and most of all in the face. There was something so
compelling about the personality of that face, that Eloise would
often sit and look at it alone when Carlos had gone out. It was
the only time she was ever alone with it, for if he were in the
apartment, he spent all his time in the studio.</p>

<p>Then one late afternoon after Rosalie had left, Carlos said:</p>

<p>“One more day, Eloise. Just one more day and it will be done.
To-morrow night I’ll be satisfied with it—I’ll even be a little proud
of it, because it is good, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>And Eloise nodded happily. For the past two weeks she had
been happier than she had ever been before, and now she was too
overcome to speak.</p>

<p>The next day Rosalie did not come, although they waited impatiently
all afternoon. Carlos tried to go on with the picture
from memory, but gave up in disgust. Without the child he was
unable to go any further. When she did not appear the next day,
Carlos became desperate. The picture was so tantalizingly near
completion, yet there was something to be added, something indefinite
which he could not name and the lack of which left him
dissatisfied and uneasy. He went to the house where she had said
she lived, but even the aunt had gone, and no one knew anything
about either of them. For a week, two weeks, Carlos alternately
waited in the studio and made fruitless attempts to locate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
child. When Eloise, fearing he would go mad with impatience,
tried to make him work on other pictures, he seemed unable to
concentrate for long on anything. The old indolence had returned
with a new force which he was unable and half-unwilling to overcome;
for the child was the only thing that could fill him with that
burning desire to paint that had driven him on, often in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>Carlos refused to give up the hope that she might yet return.
For hours in the afternoon he would go up to the studio, and,
putting on his painting jacket, sit gazing hopelessly at the picture,
or make sudden attempts that were over almost as soon as begun
to complete the portrait. Fall passed—the fall that had so nearly
brought realization—and winter came. The studio became dark
early in the afternoons, and no childish laugh returned to lighten
the dusk.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>The Chronicles of Rodriguez.</i> By <span class="smcap">Lord Dunsany</span>. (G. P.
Putnam’s Sons.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">“Be always drunken!” said Charles Baudelaire. “Be always
and forever drunken—with wine, with poetry, or with virtue,
as you choose.” Our best of all possible worlds has, indeed, run
aground on evil days since then. To become drunken by any of
the means which Baudelaire suggests, is to arouse comment, if not
suspicion, in the year nineteen twenty-two.</p>

<p>Only one last refuge is left to those who would be always and
forever drunken—the tales of Lord Dunsany. And, in his latest
book, this literary Bacchus has not failed us. For “The Chronicles
of Rodriguez” are apt to make all lovers of beauty in words
very drunken—as drunken as men used to grow in Merry England
who drank too deeply of the magic rymes of Spenser.</p>

<p>His real name was Rodriguez Trinidad Fernandez Concepcion
Henrique Maria—and, before the tale is done, even that stupendous
name has grown in stature by the breadth of a title or two,
such is the magic warmth of Golden Spain. His father, the
old Lord of the Valleys of Arguento Harez, from whose heights
Angelico swore he saw Valladolid once; his father was grieved,
as he lay dying, to see that Rodriguez’s younger brother had
grown to manhood dull and clever, one on whom those traits that
women love had not been bestowed by God. And so, knowing
that the poor fellow could gain nothing for himself, since women
are the arbiters of all things here on earth, and for aught he knew
hereafter, the old Lord gave him all his lands and goods, except
only his ancient Castilian sword. This he gave to Rodriguez, his
eldest son, in the grand manner that they had at that time in Spain,
saying, “I leave you, my son, well content that you have the two
accomplishments that are most needful in a Christian man, skill
with the sword and a way with the mandolin.” Then he gathered
up his strength for the last time and looked at his son. “The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
sword to the wars,” he said. “The mandolin to the balconies.”</p>

<p>And now, since no one can hear of such a tale and rest content
until they know what further magic is in store, I leave you all,
like the old Lord, content that you will go to seek the wars and
the balconies—which is the business of a book reviewer.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>Shoes of the Wind.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hilda Conkling</span>. (Frederick A.
Stokes Co.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Readers of “Poems by a Little Girl” who were surprised at
the extraordinarily beautiful poetry such a little girl could
produce, will be even more surprised and pleased by the contents
of this second volume. Hilda Conkling, with her childhood simplicity
of ideas, seems to have discovered unconsciously the most
satisfactory content for poems in <i>verse libre</i>. Naïveté is stilted
in metrical form, but seems to run truly like “shoes of the wind”
along the irregularities of free verse, whereas the vulgar aphorisms
of some contemporaries would be more likeable if they were
better clothed with the conventionalities of metre and rhyme.</p>

<p>Wordsworth would have loved Hilda Conkling. She would
have been ample proof for him that children come, “trailing clouds
of glory”. Here is her own expression of it:</p>

<p>“Shoes of the Wind” will delight anyone who likes lyrical poetry
of the most beautiful sort.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>The Glimpses of the Moon.</i> By <span class="smcap">Edith Wharton</span>. (D. Appleton
&amp; Company.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">At the moment of writing this review, Mrs. Wharton’s publishers
announce that the public continues to inconsiderately
overtax and distress them, by calling for “Glimpses of the Moon”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
at the rate of three thousand copies a day. This, of course, is
quite as it should be. But we still venture to hope that at least
one hundred persons per day will join us in a courageous effort
to forget all about it, and await Mrs. Wharton’s next book, just
as if nothing had happened. It is evidently too much to hope for
another “Age of Innocence” at once—but one is only too glad to
wait for it.</p>

<p>As for the immensely more important two thousand nine hundred,
they will find that they have purchased three hundred and
sixty-four pages of what looks like good solid reading matter,
only to find it so adroitly written that it slips away at almost a
single sitting, and forces one to decide what to read next.</p>

<p>Should they decide to turn out the light and pull up the covers,
however, they may do so secure in the knowledge that Susy and
her Nick at last realize that “this is love! This must be love!”,
and determined to call off the divorce that has been threatening all
through the book. It is all very splendid, for Nick could have
married the Hicks millions, and Susy might have been Lady
Altringham five minutes after the decree was issued. Lest anyone
should be unduly stampeded by this outline of the plot, we might
mention that Mrs. Wharton has carefully avoided “the tiny garments”,
and that it is while mothering the children of a stray
acquaintance that she, together with Nick, finally glimpses the
moon, which has been decidedly under a cloud during most of
the book.</p>

<h3 class="book"><i>Breath of Life.</i> By <span class="smcap">Arthur Tuckerman</span>. (G. P. Putnam’s
Sons.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">We learn from the jacket (that most entertaining part of so
many books; for there pure imagination soars into the
literary empyrian—) that Mr Tuckerman is “a new American
writer of twenty-five”. Warned by that designation to expect one
of the precocious works of cynical sophistication of the terrible
“younger school”, we cannot be anything but agreeably surprised
when that turns out to be an erroneous supposition. In its early
chapters “Breath of Life” does not treat of the collegiate youth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
who sits out dances with worldly-wise and unsurpriseable débutantes,
and gets drunk in fashionable cafés; but that sort of thing
has been done so much in “first novels” of late that the aspect is
negligible. The main part of the story is frankly given over to
that type which calls for gallant action, and gay, not too-analytically-treated
romance; as such it makes for easy, delightful
reading.</p>

<p>Everett Gail has left college—“New Haven”—after two lazy,
profitless years, to see whether business cannot end his restlessness
and give purpose to his existence. He soon finds that office work
makes him an automaton, and the incidental round of parties
bores him. He disgraces himself before the one girl he cares
at all about by getting drunk, and it is while in this condition that
he climbs aboard a ship bound for the Caribbean. The harsh
realities of the work on shipboard end when he dives overboard
in the harbor of Santa Palina, and there he finds the life of excitement
which he craves. Days of adventurous intrigue and revolutionary
plots follow, with the necessary love-element in the
person of an insurgent leader’s charming daughter. In the end
he saves an astonishing number of American Marines’ lives, receives
the thanks of his government,—and sails back home.</p>

<p>“Breath of Life” is not a profound book; it propounds no
unsolvable problems; and there are certain banalities and traces
of a still immature style evident. These are the natural signs of
a new author’s development. But it is the sort of book that you
will enjoy reading. Mr. Tuckerman’s characterizations are rather
good; his sense of scene is excellent. For those of us who desire
an occasional respite from the rigors of Yale’s iron-clad curriculum,
“Breath of Life” offers pleasant relaxation.</p>

<h3><i>The Climax.</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap">It was past twelve, on make-up night. Two hundred odd contributors
were clustered about the window of the <span class="smcap">Lit.</span> office in which the Table of
Contents was to be posted. The Yale Literary Renaissance had converted
into a mob-scene what had been formerly a nocturne embracing a window,
a lamp-post and a deserted middle-ground.</p>

<p>A general tensity prevailed. There was, to be sure, a certain amount of
thoughtless jostling and crowding. The <span class="smcap">Yale Literary Magazine</span> seldom
publishes more than ten pieces, of which approximately seven are by the
editors. This fact tends to whet outside competition, and introduces an
element of curiosity and despair.</p>

<h3><i>The Anti-Climax.</i></h3>

<p>Inside the office, Richard Cory, Ahaseurus, Bukis, The Egoist, and Mr.
Benson were all sound asleep. In this unguarded moment of repose there
was little if anything about their countenances which indicated the Intellegensia.
I am glad to say that the only one of these gentlemen who was
superior enough not to snore was</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
